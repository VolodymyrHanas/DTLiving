//
//  In an image, intensity of a pixel is defined as the value of the pixel. For example in an 8 bit grayscale image there are 256 gray levels. Now any pixel in an image can have a value from 0 to 255 and that will be its intensity
//
//  Now coming to brightness, as already answered brightness is a relative term. Suppose A, B and C are three pixels having intensities 1, 30 and 250, then C is brighter and A & B are darker with repsect to C. In general you can say the higher the intensity the brighter is the pixel.
